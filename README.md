# Machine Learning Engineering for Production

Welcome to the public repo for [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)'s Machine Learning Engineering for Production Specialization.

Here you will find public resources for the courses of this specialization.

## Personal Project and Skills Demonstration

As part of the Machine Learning Engineering for Production Specialization by deeplearning.ai, I completed several hands-on projects that demonstrate my proficiency in MLOps and production-ready machine learning systems. This repository showcases my work and the skills I've acquired:

### Key Projects:

1. **End-to-End ML Production System Design**: Developed a comprehensive ML system, from project scoping to deployment, demonstrating my ability to architect complex ML solutions.

2. **Model Baseline and Concept Drift Handling**: Implemented strategies to establish model baselines and address concept drift, showcasing my skills in maintaining model performance over time.

3. **Data Pipeline Development**: Created robust data pipelines for various data types (structured, unstructured, small-scale, and big data), highlighting my data engineering capabilities.

4. **Model Deployment and Monitoring**: Designed and implemented deployment strategies and monitoring systems, demonstrating my proficiency in maintaining production ML systems.

5. **Error Analysis and Continuous Improvement**: Conducted thorough error analyses and implemented continuous improvement strategies, showcasing my analytical and problem-solving skills.

### Skills Demonstrated:

- ML System Architecture
- Data Pipeline Engineering
- Model Development and Optimization
- MLOps Best Practices
- Deployment Strategies
- Performance Monitoring and Optimization
- Handling Concept Drift
